# Corpus triage ledger

Every corpus case is in exactly one implementation state:

- **green** — passes against the current pipeline (the default; not listed here).
- **expected-fail** — not implemented yet; listed below with the phase that owns it.

Design-level changes also go to the relevant public documentation topic and
`CHANGELOG.md`.

CI gate: zero unexpected failures; the expected-fail list only shrinks.

## Expected-fail

None.

## Depth ledger

One-time review at `02625d9d`, by ID prefix; existing rows stay as regression
coverage, but parser-only variants without a demonstrated threat would not be
added again.

- `exec` (296): threat-driven execution and exfiltration boundaries; further parser-only spellings need a new threat.
- `self-protection.critical` (198): threat-driven coverage of Nah's own tamper surface and ways to overwrite or remove trusted state.
- `infra-iac-destroy` (135): threat-driven whole-stack loss boundaries, with parser-driven option variants that would not be extended without a new threat.
- `fs-system-tree` (125): threat-driven broad filesystem loss across execution paths; further parser-only variants need a new threat.
- `git-remote-repo-delete` (104): parser-driven IDN hostname and Go template depth stays as regression cover for existing parser code and is not extended.
- `shell-resolution` (81): threat-driven command-resolution boundaries on Nah's own tamper surface.
- `self-protection.negative` (54): threat-driven controls delimiting Nah's own tamper surface so ordinary workflows remain usable.
- `secrets-credentials` (52): threat-driven credential exposure across stores and path aliases; further parser-only variants need a new threat.
